## Linear Regression to Predict

According to results, the variables, Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance as well as the Intercept, are statistically
unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Based on those results, we can conclude that
these variables have sigificant impacton the MPG.

No. The slope is not zero (0), because there is no significant linear relationship between the dependent value and
the independent variables. Therefore our linear model would be a flat line with a slope of zero (0).

The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototype effectively because 71% of mpg's variability as a
dependent variable is explained using the linear model.

The p-Val of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance of 0.05%.

Thereby concluding , there is sufficient evidence to reject my null hypothesis, which means that the slope of this
linear model is not zero.

1) Which variables/coeefficient provided a non-random amount of variane to the mpg values in the dataset.
2) Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?
3) Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils
not exceed 100 lbs per sq. inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all
manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually?  Why or why not?
